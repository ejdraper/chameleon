= Chameleon

* http://github.com/ejdraper/chameleon

== DESCRIPTION:

This is a Rails engine designed to make it super easy to expose data from your application as widgets for use with Geckoboard (http://geckoboard.com).

This only works for Rails 3 apps.

== FEATURES:

This provides a generator to build widgets using a basic DSL syntax to describe the data to be exposed, and the settings for it to be exposed under, and also includes the controller/routing necessary to provide an endpoint for Geckoboard to retrieve the data to display on your dashboard.

Currently it supports the "number and optional secondary stat" (with optional display text), "line", "pie", "geckometer", "rag" and "text" widget types.

== SYNOPSIS:

Simply add to your Gemfile as follows:

  gem 'chameleon'

Edit your routes to include:

    match "widgets/:id", :to => "widgets#show"

Then run "bundle install" and once installed, you can run:

  rails g chameleon:widget NAME TYPE

to generate a widget within "app/widgets". For example, if you want to generate a widget that exposes the amount of users you have in your app currently:

  rails g chameleon:widget users number_and_secondary

This will generate something similar to the following in "app/widgets/users_widget.rb":

  widget :users do
    key "3638c90ec12d5a59061ad7b78afcbd050e50b621"
    type "number_and_secondary"
    data do
    end
  end

To implement your widget, you simply need to alter it to return the required data - for a "number_and_secondary" type of widget, it requires a hash containing a :value, and optionally, a :previous value to compare it to (such as user count as of yesterday, for example):

  widget :users do
    key "3618c90ec02d5a57061ad7b78afcbb050e50b608"
    type "number_and_secondary"
    data do
      {
        :value => User.count,
        :previous => User.count(:conditions => "created_at < '#{1.day.ago.to_s(:db)}'")
      }
    end
  end

You can then point Geckoboard at your widget, http://myapp/widgets/users?key=3618c90ec02d5a57061ad7b78afcbb050e50b608, and Geckoboard will then show the current user count, as well as the percentage difference compared to a day ago.

More documentation on the settings available for the widgets, as well as the different types of widgets, is available on the wiki (http://github.com/ejdraper/chameleon/wiki).

== REQUIREMENTS:

A Rails 3 application.

== INSTALL:

It's best to add it to the Gemfile for your Rails 3 app, but if needed you can install the gem manually:

  gem install chameleon
